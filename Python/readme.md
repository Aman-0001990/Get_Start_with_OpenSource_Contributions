# Python Tasks

### Task 1. Simple Calculator
Create a program that takes two numbers as input from the user and performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should display the result to the user.

### Task 2. Number Guessing Game
Create a program where the computer generates a random number, and the user has to guess it. The program should provide feedback to the user, indicating if their guess is too high or too low. The game continues until the user correctly guesses the number.

### Task 3. Area and Perimeter Calculator
Write a program that calculates the area and perimeter of basic shapes such as rectangles, squares, and circles. The program should ask the user for necessary inputs (length, width, radius) and display the results.

### Task 4. Password Generator
Create a program that generates a random password based on user-specified criteria. The program should allow the user to choose the length and character types (letters, numbers, symbols) for the password.

### Task 5. Grade Calculator
Develop a program that calculates the average grade based on individual test scores. The program should ask the user for test scores and display the average to the user.

### Task 6. Email Validation. 
Develop an email validator using string functions. The program checks whether the entered email is valid or not.

### Task 7. Email Slicer.
Develop an email slicer in Python. A program that takes particular email and slices it into the username, domain and extension.
